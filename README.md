Conditional exercises for C++

Exercise 1. Write a program immitating a vending machine. The program should present the user  with a choice of 6 products of your choice (Coke, Water, Chocolate Bar etc). Then allow the user to choose a product by entering a number 1-6. Add an exception for invalid input if the user inputs a number which doesn't correspond to any choice.

Exercise 2. Using SWITCH modify the vending machine program from the Conditional Statements. Write a program imitating a vending machine. The program should present the user with a choice of 6 products of your choice (Coke, Water, Chocolate Bar etc). Then allow the user to choose a product by entering a number 1-6. Add an exception for invalid input if the user inputs a number which doesn'tcorrespond to any choice.

Exercise 3. Write a program that lists the months (January to December) from 1 to 12. It should ask the user to input the number of the month. Then using switch the program answers how many days there are in that month. In case of February, the user has to input the year (in order to check leap year). The conditions to satisfy a leap year:
  - The year must be divisible by 4.
  - If the year is divisible by 100, then it is not a leap year.
  - EXCEPT if the year is divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.

Exercise 4. Write an application that asks the user to input his age. Then using the conditional operator (ternary operator) check if the user age is higher or equal to 18. 

Exercise 5. Write an application that asks the user to input the points he achieved on an exam.  If the number of points was higher than 50 the user should be notified that he/she passed the exam - use the conditional operator. The number of points which a student was able to achieve from the exam was from 0 - 100 hence, if the user inputs a number which doesn't belong to this interval the output should be an error message.
